An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word. Complete the function to return `true` if the two arguments given are anagrams of each other; return `false` otherwise.

This array represents the value of a stock (AAPL) for each minute of the previous trading day. Assuming you have 1 share of stock, find the time yesterday that you could have made the most money by selling that share. `var AAPL = [100, 111, 98, 97, 102, 101, 103, 111]`
