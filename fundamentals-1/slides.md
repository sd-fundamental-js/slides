## Teaching Philosophy

- We will involve you (the audience) as much as possible.

- You will be asked to "best-guess" answers to questions you may not know the answers to.

- You will be asked to take "leaps of faith" to quickly establish healthy programming habits. The "why" will come later.

- By actively participating, you are more likely to create new neural pathways and learn faster.

# Ready to learn?!

- Stand up! Shake off that evening fatigue!

- Shout "I will learn JavaScript!" as loud as you can three times!

### Introduction to JavaScript

- Let's start from the beginning.
